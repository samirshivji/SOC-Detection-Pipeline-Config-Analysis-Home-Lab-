# üõ°Ô∏è SOC Detection Pipeline (Home Lab)

This project simulates a real-world SOC detection pipeline using open-source tools in a home lab environment. This lab focuses on capturing endpoint telemetry, tuning detections, and mapping alerts to MITRE ATT&CK techniques using Wazuh, Sysmon, and Elasticsearch. 
Based on the MyDFIR YouTube

## üöÄ Project Objectives

- Build and configure a lightweight SIEM pipeline
- Ingest rich endpoint telemetry from a Windows system
- Create and tune detection rules using Wazuh
- Validate alerts for simulated attacker behavior (e.g., Mimikatz)
- Map detections to MITRE ATT&CK techniques

## üìö Project Breakdown

### ‚úÖ Part 1 ‚Äì Initial Lab Setup
![SIEM PIPELINE DIAGRAM](SOC-Detection-Pipeline-Config-Analysis-Home-Lab-/1.diagram.png)
- Set up two VMs:
  - **Ubuntu Server**: Hosts Wazuh Manager and Elasticsearch
  - **Windows 10**: Used as the monitored endpoint
- Installed:
  - Wazuh Manager, Wazuh API, Elasticsearch
- Registered the Windows endpoint with the Wazuh Manager
- Verified communication and log ingestion using the Wazuh Dashboard

---

### üîí Part 2 ‚Äì Endpoint Telemetry with Sysmon

- Installed **Sysmon** and the **Wazuh Agent** on the Windows VM
- Applied a custom **Sysmon configuration** (based on SwiftOnSecurity's template)
- Configured **Winlogbeat/Filebeat** to ship Windows Event Logs to Wazuh
- Captured key telemetry:
  - Process creation
  - Network connections
  - DLL loading

---

### üß† Part 3 ‚Äì MITRE ATT&CK Alerting

- Explored how Wazuh rules map to **MITRE ATT&CK techniques**
- Filtered and reviewed MITRE-mapped alerts in the **Wazuh Dashboard**
- Simulated suspicious behavior to trigger built-in MITRE-mapped detections

---

### üß™ Part 4 ‚Äì Rule Tuning & Custom Detection

- Modified Wazuh configuration to collect all events for testing purposes
- Created a **custom detection rule** to identify **Mimikatz** execution (even when renamed)
- Mapped the rule to:
  - **MITRE ATT&CK ID:** `T1003 ‚Äì Credential Dumping`
- Validated detection successfully via Wazuh alerting
